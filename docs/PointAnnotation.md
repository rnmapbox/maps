# <MapboxGL.PointAnnotation />
PointAnnotation represents a one-dimensional shape located at a single geographical coordinate.

Consider using ShapeSource and SymbolLayer instead, if you have many points and you have static images,
they'll offer much better performance.

If you need interactive views please use MarkerView,
as with PointAnnotation on Android child views are rendered onto a bitmap for better performance.
