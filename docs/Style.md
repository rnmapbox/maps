Style is a component that automatically adds sources / layers to the map using Mapbox GL Style Spec.
Only [`sources`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/sources) & [`layers`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/) are supported.
Other fields such as `sprites`, `glyphs` etc. will be ignored. Not all layer / source attributes from the style spec are supported, in general the supported attributes will be mentioned under https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps/tree/main/docs.
