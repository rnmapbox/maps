```tsx
import { MarkerView } from '@rnmapbox/maps';

MarkerView

```
MarkerView represents an interactive React Native marker on the map.

If you have static views, consider using PointAnnotation or SymbolLayer to display
an image, as they'll offer much better performance. Mapbox suggests using this
component for a maximum of around 100 views displayed at one time.

This is implemented with view annotations on [Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations/)
and [iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations).

This component has no dedicated `onPress` method. Instead, you should handle gestures
with the React views passed in as `children`.

## props

  
### coordinate

```tsx
Position
```
_required_
The center point (specified as a map coordinate) of the marker.


  
### anchor

```tsx
type Anchor = {
  x: number; /* FIX ME NO DESCRIPTION */
  y: number; /* FIX ME NO DESCRIPTION */
}
```
Any coordinate between (0, 0) and (1, 1), where (0, 0) is the top-left corner of
the view, and (1, 1) is the bottom-right corner. Defaults to the center at (0.5, 0.5).

  _defaults to:_ `{ x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }`

  
### allowOverlap
