## <MapboxGL.MarkerView />
### MarkerView allows you to place a interactive react native marker to the map. If you have static view consider using PointAnnotation or SymbolLayer they'll offer much better performance.<br/>This is based on [MakerView plugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/overview/markerview/) on android and PointAnnotation on iOS.
