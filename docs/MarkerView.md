# <MapboxGL.MarkerView />
MarkerView represents an interactive React Native marker on the map.

If you have static views, consider using PointAnnotation or SymbolLayer to display
an image, as they'll offer much better performance. Mapbox suggests using this
component for a maximum of around 100 views displayed at one time.

This is implemented with view annotations on [Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations/)
and [iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/annotations/view-annotations).

This component has no dedicated `onPress` method. Instead, you should handle gestures
with the React views passed in as `children`.
