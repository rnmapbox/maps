## <MapboxGL.MarkerView />
### MarkerView allows you to place a interactive react native marker to the map.<br/><br/>If you have static view consider using PointAnnotation or SymbolLayer they'll offer much better performance<br/>.<br/>This is based on [MakerView plugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/overview/markerview/) on Android<br/>and PointAnnotation on iOS.
