# <MapboxGL.MarkerView />
MarkerView allows you to place an interactive React Native marker to the map.

If you have static view consider using PointAnnotation or SymbolLayer they'll offer much better performance.

This is based on [MakerView plugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/overview/markerview/) on Android
and PointAnnotation on iOS.
