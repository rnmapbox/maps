# <MapboxGL.heading />
The heading (measured in degrees) relative to true north.
Heading is used to describe the direction the device is pointing to (the value of the compass).
Note that on Android this is incorrectly reporting the course value as mentioned in issue 
and will be corrected in a future update.
