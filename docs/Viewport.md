```tsx
import { Viewport } from '@rnmapbox/maps';

Viewport

```
provides a structured approach to organizing camera management logic into states and transitions between them.

At any given time, the viewport is either:
 - idle
 - in a state (camera is being managed by a ViewportState)
 - transitioning between states

See [android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/api/${ANDROID_SDK_VERSION}/mapbox-maps-android/com.mapbox.maps.plugin.viewport/viewport.html),
[ios](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/api/${IOS_SDK_VERSION}/Viewport.html#/s:10MapboxMaps8ViewportC)

## props

  
### transitionsToIdleUponUserInteraction

```tsx
boolean
```
Indicates whether the Viewport should idle when the MapView receives touch input.

Set this property to false to enable building custom ViewportStates that can work simultaneously with certain types of gestures.

Defaults to true.


  
### onStatusChanged

```tsx
func
```
Subscribes to status changes, will be called when the status changes.

Observers are notified of status changes asynchronously on the main queue.
This means that by the time the notification is delivered, the status may have already changed again.
This behavior is necessary to allow observers to trigger further transitions while avoiding out-of-order
delivery of status changed notifications.
